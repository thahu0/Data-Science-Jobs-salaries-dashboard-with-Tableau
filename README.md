# Data-Science-Jobs-salaries-dashboard-with-Tableau
Embarking on a self-study journey to enhance my Tableau skills, I decided to build a trending Tableau dashboard focused on data science job salaries.

Have you ever wondered how data science professionals visualize job market trends?


I decided to build a trending Tableau dashboard focused on data science job salaries. The process was incredibly rewarding and left me feeling overwhelmed (in the best way!) by the insights and creativity involved.

For this project, I created a Data Science Jobs Salaries Dashboard. Here are the steps I followed:

Downloaded Tableau 14-day free trial: Got hands-on with this powerful data visualization tool.

Imported dataset from Kaggle: Used the dataset available at Data Science Job Salaries.

Created donut charts:

Total companies by size and location.

Experience level distribution.

Employment type distribution.

Created horizontal bar charts:

Top 10 employee residences.

Built an average salary chart: Visualized salaries based on experience level and employment type.

Created an average salary map: Displayed average salaries by country.

Designed a table for average salary by job title and experience level: Highlighted specific roles like Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer.

Integrated all visuals into an interactive dashboard: Made it easy to drill down into data insights.

Enabled dynamic filtering with drop-down views: For the screenshots, I filtered by:

Image 1: Job title: Machine Learning Engineer, Company location: IN.

Image 2: Job title: Data Scientist, Company location: US.

What's in the images?

Image 1: Displays insights specific to Machine Learning Engineer roles in India, including average salary, employment type (full-time), and top countries of residence.

Image 2: Focuses on Data Scientist roles in the US, showcasing salaries, experience level, and global salary distribution.

Concluding this project, I’m thrilled with how much I’ve learned and the professional skills I’ve honed. Creating this dashboard not only helped me explore the power of Tableau but also allowed me to analyze and present meaningful data in an engaging way.

Excited to keep building, learning, and sharing! Feedback and thoughts are welcome!
